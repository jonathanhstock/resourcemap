# About This Project
Built this project with other teammates for the Hack4Humanity hackathon sponsored by Santa Clara University. 

# Inspiration
We wanted to think of something that would change people's perspectives on searching for help. There should be simple ways of looking for help and categorizing them accordingly. When I was thinking of a problem that this solves I searched up homeless shelters nearby and a couple of animal shelters popped up which wasn't what I was looking for exactly.

# What it does
Searches the local area from the zip code at Santa Clara University for nearby resources for people in need. Displays these resources as pins on a map that are clickable to show their addresses.

# How we built it
We used React.js along with a Leaflet map API called Leaflet.js to create a static map with the pins on it and design the website. We also used CSS for styling elements throughout the website.

# Challenges we ran into
As most of us were unfamiliar with React, we struggled with the syntax and getting the webpage's route paths to properly connect. Also, we struggled a lot with implementing the map API as we were stuck between choosing the Leaflet API or Google Maps API.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have made a working webpage with the features we imagined. There's a lot to improve on, but we're proud of our results that we got so far given that this is all of our team's first hackathon.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about using React and JavaScript along with how it interacts with HTML as it is all JSX that looks like HTML sort of but works like JavaScript at the same time.

# What's next for Resource Locater
Expansion. We want to expand our map to the Bay Area and then eventually California. Perhaps we could have a dynamic map that adjusts to certain zip codes and auto-populates with places nearby. We also want to add a way for direct payment under our donate now button. Also, we want to include step-by-step directions from the user's current location to arrive at the place.
